<h2>THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE LONDON MEDICAL STUDENT.</h2>
<h3>9.&mdash;OF THE SEQUEL TO THE HALL EXAMINATION.</h3>
<div class="dropcap"><a href="images/020-01.png"><img src=
"images/020-01.png" alt=
"Three men stand facing away from each other form a letter W with their overcoats."
id="img020-01" name="img020-01" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p><span class="hide">W</span>hilst Mr. Muff follows the beadle
from the funking-room to the Council Chamber, he scarcely knows
whether he is walking upon his head or his heels; if anything, he
believes that he is adopting the former mode of locomotion; nor
does he recover a sense of his true position until he finds himself
seated at one end of a square table, the other three sides whereof
are occupied by the same number of gentlemen of grave and austere
bearing, with all the candles in the room apparently endeavouring
to imitate that species of eccentric dance which he has only seen
the gas-lamps attempt occasionally as he has returned home from his
harmonic society. The table before him is invitingly spread with
pharmacopoeias, books of prescriptions, trays of drugs, and
half-dead plants; and upon these subjects, for an hour and a half,
he is compelled to answer questions.</p>
<p>We will not follow his examination: nobody was ever able to see
the least joke in it; and therefore it is unfitted for our columns.
We can but state that after having been puzzled, bullied,
&ldquo;caught,&rdquo; quibbled with, and abused, for the above
space of time, his good genius prevails, and he is told he may
retire. Oh! the pleasure with which he re-enters the
funking-room&mdash;that nice, long, pleasant room, with its
cheerful fireplace and good substantial book-cases, and valuable
books, and excellent old-fashioned furniture; and the capital tea
which the worshipful company allows him&mdash;never was meal so
exquisitely relished. He has passed the Hall! won&rsquo;t he have a
flare-up to-night!&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>As soon as all the candidates have passed, their certificates
are given them, upon payment of various sovereigns, and they are
let out. The first great rush takes place to the &ldquo;retail
establishment&rdquo; over the way, where all their friends are
assembled&mdash;Messrs. Jones, Rapp, Manhug, &amp;c. A pot of
&ldquo;Hospital Medoc&rdquo; is consumed by each of the thirsty
candidates, and off they go, jumping Jim Crow down Union-street,
and swaggering along the pavement six abreast, as they sing several
extempore variations of their own upon a glee which details divers
peculiarities in the economy of certain small pigs, pleasantly
enlivened by grunts and whistles, and the occasional asseveration
of the singers that their paternal parent was a man of less than
ordinary stature. This insensibly changes into &ldquo;Willy brewed
a Peck of Malt,&rdquo; and finally settles down into &ldquo;Nix my
Dolly,&rdquo; appropriately danced and chorussed, until a
policeman, who has no music in his soul, stops their harmony, but
threatens to take them into charge if they do not bring their
promenade concert to a close.</p>
<p>Arrived at their lodgings, the party throw off all restraint.
The table is soon covered with beer, spirits, screws, hot water,
and pipes; and the company take off their coats, unbutton their
stocks, and proceed to conviviality. Mr. Muff, who is in the chair,
sings the first song, which informs his friends that the glasses
sparkle on the board and the wine is ruby bright, in allusion to
the pewter-pots and half-and half. Having finished, Mr. Muff calls
upon Mr. Jones, who sings a ballad, not altogether perhaps of the
same class you would hear at an evening party in Belgrave-square,
but still of infinite humour, which is applauded upon the table to
a degree that flirps all the beer out of the pots, with which Mr.
Rapp draws portraits and humorous conceits upon the table with his
finger. Mr. Manhug is then called upon, and sings</p>

</div>
<p>This song is vociferously cheered, except by Mr. Rapp, who
during its execution has been engaged in making an elaborate piece
of basket-work out of wooden pipe-lights, which having arranged to
his satisfaction, he sends scudding at the chairman&rsquo;s head.
The harmony proceeds, and with it the desire to assist in it, until
they all sing different airs at once; and the lodger above, who has
vainly endeavoured to get to sleep for the last three hours, gives
up the attempt as hopeless, when he hears Mr. Manhug called upon
for the sixth time to do the cat and dog, saw the bit of wood,
imitate Macready, sing his own version of
&ldquo;Lur-li-e-ty,&rdquo; and accompany it with his elbows on the
table.</p>
<p>The first symptom of approaching cerebral excitement from the
action of liquid stimulants is perceived in Mr. Muff himself, who
tries to cut some cold meat with the snuffers. Mr. Simpson also, a
new man, who is looking very pale, rather overcome with the effects
of his elementary screw in a first essay to perpetrate a pipe,
petitions for the window to be let down, that the smoke, which you
might divide with a knife, may escape more readily. This
proposition is unanimously negatived, until Mr. Jones, who is
tilting his chair back, produces the desired effect by
overbalancing himself in the middle of a comic medley, and causing
a compound, comminuted, and irreducible fracture of three panes of
glass by tumbling through them. Hereat, the harmony experiencing a
temporary check, and all the half-and half having disappeared, Mr.
Muff finds there is no great probability of getting any more, as
the servant who attends upon the seven different lodgers has long
since retired to rest in the turn-down bedstead of the back
kitchen. An adjournment is therefore determined upon; and,
collecting their hats and coats as they best may, the whole party
tumble out into the streets at two o&rsquo;clock in the
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whiz-z-z-z-z-t!&rdquo; shouts Mr. Manhug, as they emerge
into the cool air, in accents which only Wieland could excel;
&ldquo;there goes a cat!&rdquo; Upon the information a volley of
hats follow the scared animal, none of which go within ten yards of
it, except Mr. Rapp&rsquo;s, who, taking a bold aim, flings his own
gossamer down the area, over the railings, as the cat jumps between
them on to the water-butt, which is always her first leap in a
hurried retreat. Whereupon Mr. Rapp goes and rings the house-bell,
that the domestics may return his property; but not receiving an
answer, and being assured of the absence of a policeman, he pulls
the handle out as far as it will come, breaks it off, and puts it
in his pocket. After this they run about the streets, indulging in
the usual buoyant recreations that innocent and happy minds so
situated delight to follow, and are eventually separated by their
flight from the police, from the safe plan they have adopted of all
running different ways when pursued, to bother the crushers. What
this leads to we shall probably hear next week, when they are once
more <em>r&eacute;unis</em> in the dissecting-room to recount their
adventures.</p>
<hr />
<p>It is said that the Duke of Wellington declined the invitation
to the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s civic dinner in the following laconic
speech:&mdash;&ldquo;Pray remember the 9th November,
1830.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Sir Peter Laurie, on
hearing the Duke&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;I remember it. They said
that the people intended on that day to set fire to Guildhall, and
meant to roast the Mayor and Board of
Aldermen.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;On the old system, I suppose, of
every man cooking his own goose,&rdquo; observed Hobler drily.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p>I cannot recollect the precise day, but it was some time in the
month of November 1839, that I took one of my usual rambles without
design or destination. I detest a premeditated route&mdash;I always
grow tired at the first mile; but with a free course, either in
town or country, I can saunter about for hours, and feel no other
fatigue but what a tumbler of toddy and a pipe can remove. It was
this disposition that made me acquainted with the fraternity of the
&ldquo;Puffs.&rdquo; I would premise, gentle reader, that as in my
peregrinations I turn down any green lane or dark alley that may
excite my admiration or my curiosity&mdash;hurry through glittering
saloons or crowded streets&mdash;pause at the cottage door or shop
window, as it best suits my humour, so, in my intercourse with you,
I shall digress, speculate, compress, and dilate, as my fancy or my
convenience wills it. This is a blunt acknowledgment of my
intentions; but as travellers are never sociable till they have
cast aside the formalities of compliment, I wished to start with
you at the first stage as an old acquaintance. The course is not
usual, and, therefore, I adopt it; and it was by thus stepping out
of a common street into a common hostel that I became possessed of
the <em>mat&eacute;riel</em> of those papers, which I trust will
hereafter tend to cheat many into a momentary forgetfulness of some
care. I have no other ambition; there are philosophers enough to
mystify or enlighten the world without my &ldquo;nose of Turk and
Tartar&rsquo;s lips&rdquo; being thrust into the cauldron,
whose</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">&mdash;&ldquo;Charms of powerful trouble,</p>
<p>Like a hell-broth, boil and bubble.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I had buttoned myself snugly in my Petersham (may the tailor who
invented <em>that</em> garment &ldquo;sleep well&rdquo; whenever he
&ldquo;wears the churchyard livery, grass-green turned up with
brown!&rdquo;) The snow&mdash;the beautiful snow&mdash;fell pure
and noiselessly on the dirty pavement. Ragged, blue-faced urchins
were scrambling the pearly particles together, and, with all the
joyous recklessness of healthier childhood, carrying on a war less
fatal but more glorious than many that have made countless widows
and orphans, and, <em>perhaps, one</em> hero. Little round
doll-like things, in lace and ribbons, were thumping second-door
windows with their tiny hands, and crowing with ecstasy at the
sight of the flaky shower. &ldquo;Baked-tater&rdquo; cans and
&ldquo;roasted-apple&rdquo; saucepan lids were sputtering and
frizzing in impotent rage as they waged puny war with the congealed
element. Hackney charioteers sat on their boxes warped and
whitened; whilst those strange amalgams of past and
<em>never-to-come</em> fashions&mdash;the clerks of
London&mdash;hurried about with the horrid consciousness of
exposing their costliest garments to the &ldquo;pelting of the
pitiless storm.&rdquo; Evening stole on. A London twilight has
nothing of the pale grey comfort that is diffused by that gradual
change from day to night which I have experienced when seated by
the hearth or the open window of a rural home. There it seems like
the very happiness of nature&mdash;a pause between the burning
passions of meridian day and the dark, sorrowing loneliness of
night; but in London on it comes, or rather down it comes, like the
mystic medium in a pantomime&mdash;it is a thing that you will not
gaze on for long; and you rush instinctively from daylight to
candle-light. I stopped in front of an old-fashioned public-house,
and soon (being a connoisseur in these matters) satisfied myself
that if comfort were the desideratum, &ldquo;The heart that was
humble might hope for it here.&rdquo; I shook the snow from my
&ldquo;Petersham,&rdquo; and seeing the word &ldquo;parlour&rdquo;
painted in white letters on a black door, bent my steps towards it.
I was on the point of opening the door, when a slim young man, with
a remarkable small quantity of hair, stopped my onward coarse by
gurgling rather than ejaculating&mdash;for the sentence seemed a
continuous word&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t-go-in-there-Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Puffs-Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Puffs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes-Sir,&mdash;Tues&rsquo;y
night&mdash;Puffs-meets-on-Tues&rsquo;y,&rdquo; and then addressing
a young girl in the bar, delivered an order for
&ldquo;One-rum-one-bran&rsquo;y-one
gin-no-whisky-all-&rsquo;ot,&rdquo; which I afterwards found to
signify one glass of each of the liqueurs.</p>
<p>I was about to remonstrate against the exclusiveness of the
&ldquo;Puffs,&rdquo; when recollecting the proverbial obduracy of
waiters, I contented myself with buttoning my coat. My annoyance
was not diminished by hearing the hearty burst of merriment called
forth by some jocular member of this <em>terra incognita</em>, but
rendered still more distressing by the appearance of the landlord,
who emerged from the room, his eyes streaming with those tears that
nature sheds over an expiring laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a merry party <em>concealed</em> there, Master
Host,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-ye-s-Sir, very,&rdquo; replied he, and tittered again,
as though he were galvanizing his defunct merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite exclusive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite, Sir, un-unless you are introduced&mdash;Oh
dear!&rdquo; and having mixed a small tumbler of toddy, he
disappeared into that inner region of smoke from which I was
separated by the black door endorsed
&ldquo;<em>Parlour</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had determined to seek elsewhere for a more social party, when
the thumping of tables and gingle of glasses induced me to abide
the issue. After a momentary pause, a firm and not unmusical voice
was heard, pealing forth the words of a song which I had written
when a boy, and had procured insertion for in a country newspaper.
At the conclusion the thumping was repeated, and the waiter having
given another of his <em>stenographical</em> orders, I could not
resist desiring him to inform the vocal gentleman that I craved a
few words with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes-Sir&mdash;don&rsquo;t-think-&rsquo;ll
come&mdash;&rsquo;cos he-&rsquo;s-in-a-corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will try the experiment,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly-Sir-two-gins-please-ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; And
having been supplied with the required beverage, he also made his
<em>exit in fumo</em>.</p>
<p>In a few minutes a man of about fifty made his appearance; his
face indicated the absence of vulgarity, though a few purply tints
delicately hinted that he had assisted at many an orgie of the rosy
offspring of Jupiter and Semele. His dark vestments and white
cravat induced me to set him down as a &ldquo;professional
gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;nor was I far wrong in my conjecture. As I
shall have, I trust, frequent occasion to speak of him, I will for
the sake of convenience, designate him Mr. Bonus.</p>
<p>I briefly stated my reason for disturbing him&mdash;that as he
had honoured my muse by forming so intimate an acquaintance with
her, I was anxious to trespass on his politeness to introduce me
into that room which had now become a sort of &ldquo;Blue-beard
blue-chamber&rdquo; to my thirsty curiosity. Having handed him my
card, he readily complied, and in another minute I was an
inhabitant of an elysium of sociality and tobacco-smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faugh!&rdquo; cries Aunt Charlotte Amelia, whilst pretty
little Cousin Emmeline turns up her round hazel eyes and
ejaculates, &ldquo;Tobacco-smoke! horrid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ladies! you treat with scorn that which God hath given as a
blessing! It has never been your lot to thread the streets of
mighty London, when the first springs of her untiring commerce are
set in motion. Long, dear aunt, before thy venerable nose peeps
from beneath the quilted coverlid <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page231" name="page231"></a>[pg 231]</span>to scent an atmosphere
made odorous by cosmetics&mdash;long, dear Emmeline, ere those
bright orbs that one day will fire the hearts of thousands are
unclosed, the artizan has blessed his sleeping children, and closed
the door upon his household gods. The murky fog, the drizzling
shower, welcome him back to toil. Labour runs before him, and with
ready hand unlocks the doors of dreary cellars or towering and
chilly edifices; mind hath not yet promulgated or received the
noble doctrine that toil is dignity; and you, yes, even you, dear,
gentle hearts! would feel the artizan a slave, if some clever
limner showed you the toiling wretch sooted or japanned. Would you
then rob him of one means of happiness? No&mdash;not even of his
pipe! Ladies, you tread on carpets or on marble floors&mdash;I will
tell you where my foot has been. I have walked where the air was
circumscribed&mdash;where man was manacled by space, for no other
crimes but those of poverty and misfortune. I&rsquo;ve seen the
broken merchant seated round a hearth that had not one
endearment&mdash;they looked about for faces that were wont to
smile upon them, and they saw but mirrors of their own sad
lineaments&mdash;some laughed in mockery of their sorrows, as
though they thought that mirth would come for asking; others, grown
brutal by being caged, made up in noise what they lacked in peace.
How comfortless they seemed! The only solace that the eye could
trace was the odious herb, tobacco!</p>
<p>I have climbed the dark and narrow stairway that led to a modern
Helicon; there I have seen the gentle creature that loved nature
for her beauty&mdash;beauty that was to him apparent, although he
sat hemmed in by bare and tattered walls; yet there he had seen
bright fountains sparkle and the earth robe herself with life, and
where the cunning spider spread her filmy toils above his head, he
has seen a world of light, a galaxy of wonders. The din of wheels
and the harsh discordant cries of busy life have died within his
ear, and the tiny voices of choral birds have hymned him into
peace; or the lettered eloquence of dread sages has become sound
again, and he has communed in the grove and temple, as they of
older time did in the eternal cities, with those whose names are
immortal&mdash;and there I have seen the humble pipe! the sole
evidence of luxury or enjoyment; when his daily task was suspended,
it can never end, for he must weave and weave the fibres of his
brain into the clue that leads him to the means of sustaining
life.</p>
<p>I have wandered through lanes and fields when the autumn was on
and the world golden, and my journey has ended at a yeoman&rsquo;s
door. My welcome has been a hand-grasp, that needed bones and
muscles to bear it unflinchingly&mdash;my fare the homeliest, but
the sweetest; and when the meal was ended, how has the night wore
on and then away over a cup of brown October&mdash;the last
autumn&rsquo;s legacy&mdash;and, forgive me, Emmeline, a pipe of
tobacco! Glorious herb! that hath oft-times stayed the progress of
sorrow and contagion; a king once consigned thee to the devil, but
many a humble, honest heart hath hailed thee as a blessing from the
Creator.</p>
<p>I was introduced by my new acquaintance without much ceremony,
and was pleased to see that little was expected. &ldquo;We meet
here thrice a week,&rdquo; said Bonus, &ldquo;just to wile away an
hour or two after the worry and fatigue of business. Most of us
have been acquainted with each other since boyhood&mdash;and we
have some curious characters amongst us; and should you wish to
enrol your name, you have only to prove your qualification for this
(holding up his pipe), and we shall be happy to recognise you as a
&lsquo;Puff.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<h3>THE STAR SYSTEM.</h3>
<p>SIR PETER LAURIE having observed a notice in one of the journals
that the superior planets, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, are now to be
seen every evening in the west, despatched a messenger to them with
an invitation to the late Polish Ball, sagely remarking that
&ldquo;three such stars must prove an attraction.&rdquo; Upon Sir

<h3>THE LIMERICK MARES.</h3>
<p>The borough of Limerick at present enjoys the singular advantage
of having two civic heads to the city. The new <em>mare</em>,
Martin Honan, Esq., after being duly elected, civilly requested the
old <em>mare</em>, C. S. Vereker, Esq., to turn out; to which he as
civilly replied that he would see him blessed first, and as he was
himself the only genuine and original donkey, he was resolved not
to yield his place at the corporate manger to the new animal. Thus
matters remain at present&mdash;the old <em>Mare</em> resolutely
refusing to take his head out of the halter until he is compelled
to do so.</p>

<h2>MORE SKETCHES OF LONDON LIFE.</h2>
<p class="cen"><em>By the Author of the &ldquo;Great
Metropolis.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that, in spite of the recent Act, there
are no less than three hundred sweeps who still continue to cry
&ldquo;sweep,&rdquo; in the very teeth of the legislative measure
alluded to. I have been in the habit of meeting many of these
sweeps at the house I use for my breakfast; and in the course of
conversation with them, I have generally found that they know they
are breaking the law in calling out &ldquo;sweep,&rdquo; but they
do not raise the cry for the mere purpose of law-breaking. I am
sure it would be found on inquiry that it is only with the view of
getting business that they call out at all; and this shows the
impolicy of making a law which is not enforced; for they all know
that it is very seldom acted upon.</p>
<p>The same argument will apply to the punishment of death; and my
friend Jack Ketch, whom I meet at the Frog and Frying-pan, tells me
that he has hanged a great many who never expected it. If I were to
be asked to make all the laws for this country, I certainly should
manage things in a very different manner; and I am glad to say that
I have legal authority on my side, for the lad who opens the door
at Mr. Adolphus&rsquo;s chambers&mdash;with whom I am on terms of
the closest intimacy&mdash;thinks as I do upon every great question
of legal and constitutional policy. But this is &ldquo;neither here
nor there,&rdquo; as my publisher told me when I asked him for the
profits of my last book, and I shall therefore drop the
subject.</p>
<p>In speaking of eminent publishers, I must not forget to mention
Mr. Catnach, to whom I owe a debt of gratitude for having been the
first to introduce me to the literary career I have since so
successfully followed. I believe I was the first who carried into
effect Mr. Catnach&rsquo;s admirable idea of having the last dying
speeches all struck off on the night before an execution, so as to
get them into the hands of the public as early as possible. It was,
moreover, my own suggestion to stereotype one speech, to be used on
all occasions; and I also must claim the merit of having
recommended the fixing a man&rsquo;s head at the top of the
document as &ldquo;a portrait of the murderer.&rdquo; Catnach and I
have always been on the best of terms, but he is naturally rather
angry that I have not always published with him, which he
thinks&mdash;and many others tell me the same thing&mdash;I always
should have done. At all events, Catnach has not much right to
complain, for he has on two occasions wholly repainted his
shop-shutters from effusions of mine; and I know that he has
greatly extended his toy and marble business through the profits of
a poetical version of the fate of Fauntleroy, which was very
popular in its day, and which I wrote for him.</p>
<p>I have never until lately had much to do with Pitts, of Seven
Dials; but I have found him an intelligent tradesman, and a very
spirited publisher. He undertook to get out in five days a new
edition of the celebrated pennyworth of poetry, known some time
back, and still occasionally met with, as the &ldquo;Three Yards of
Popular Songs,&rdquo; which were all selected by me, and for which
I chose every one of the vignettes that were prefixed to them. I
have had extensive dealings both with Pitts and Catnach; and in
comparing the two men, I should say one was the Napoleon of
literature, the other the Mrs. Fry. Catnach is all for dying
speeches and executions, while Pitts is peculiarly partial to
poetry. Pitts, for instance, has printed thousands of &ldquo;My
Pretty Jane,&rdquo; while Catnach had the execution of Frost all in
type for many months before his trial. It is true that Frost never
was hanged, but Blakesley was; and the public, to whom the document
was issued when the latter event occurred, had nothing to do but to
bear in mind the difference of the names, and the account would do
as well for one as for the other. Catnach has been blamed for this;
but it will not be expected that <em>I</em> shall censure any one
for the grossest literary quackery.</p>

<h3>ACTIVE BENEVOLENCE.</h3>
<p>The success of the Polish Ball has induced some humane
individuals to propose that a similar festival should take place
for the relief of the distressed Spitalfields weavers. We like the
notion of a charitable quadrille&mdash;or a benevolent waltz; and
it delights us to see a philanthropic design <em>set on foot</em>,
through the medium of a gallopade. A dance which has for its object
the putting of bread in the mouths of our fellow-creatures, may be

<p><span class="hide">D</span>octors Spurzheim and Gall have
acquired immense renown for their ingenious and plausible system of
phrenology. These eminent philosophers have by a novel and
wonderful process divided that which is indivisible, and parcelled
out the human mind into several small lots, which they call
&ldquo;<em>organs</em>,&rdquo; numbering and labelling them like
the drawers or bottles in a chemist&rsquo;s shop; so that, should
any individual acquainted with the science of phrenology chance to
get into what is vulgarly termed &ldquo;a row,&rdquo; and being
withal of a meek and lamb like disposition, which prompts him
rather to trust to his heels than to his fists, he has only to
excite his organ of <em>combativeness</em> by scratching vigorously
behind his ear, and he will forthwith become bold as a lion,
valiant as a game-cock&mdash;in short, a very lad of
<em>whacks</em>, ready to fight the devil if he dared him. In like
manner, a constant irritation of the organ of <em>veneration</em>
on the top of his head will make him an accomplished courtier, and
imbue him with a profound respect for stars and coronets. Now if it
be possible&mdash;and that it is, no one will now attempt to
deny&mdash;to divide the brain into distinct faculties, why may not
the stomach, which, it has been admitted by the Lord Mayor and the
Board of Aldermen, is a far nobler organ than the brain,&mdash;why
may it not also possess several faculties? As we know that a
particular part of the brain is appropriated for the faculty of
<em>time</em>, another for that of <em>wit</em>, and so on, is it
not reasonable to suppose that there is a certain portion of the
stomach appropriated to the faculty of <em>roast beef</em>, another
for that of <em>devilled kidney</em> and so forth?</p>
<p>It may be said that the stomach is a single organ, and therefore
incapable of performing more than one function. As well might it be
asserted that it was a steam-engine, with a single furnace
consuming Whitehaven, Scotch, or Newcastle coals indiscriminately.
The fact is, the stomach is not a single organ, but in reality a
congeries of organs, each receiving its own proper kind of aliment,
and developing itself by outward bumps and prominences, which
indicate with amazing accuracy the existence of the particular
faculty to which it has been assigned.</p>
<p>It is upon these facts that I have founded my system of
Stomachology; and contemplating what has been done, what is doing,
and what is likely to be done, in the analogous science of
phrenology, I do not despair of seeing the human body mapped out,
and marked all over with faculties, feelings, propensities, and
powers, like a tattooed New Zealander. The study of anatomy will
then be entirely superseded, and the scientific world would be
guided, as the fashionable world is now, entirely by externals.</p>
<p>The circumstances which led me to the discovery of this
important constitution of the stomach were partly accidental, and
partly owing to my own intuitive sagacity. I had long observed that
Judy, &ldquo;my soul&rsquo;s far dearer part,&rdquo; entertained a
decided partiality for a leg of pork and pease-pudding&mdash;to
which <em>I</em> have a positive dislike. On extending my
observations, I found that different individuals were characterised
by different tastes in food, and that one man liked mint sauce with
his roast lamb, while others detested it. I discovered also that in
most persons there is a predominance of some particular organ over
the surrounding ones, in which case a corresponding external
protuberance may be looked for, which indicates the gastronomic
character of the individual. This rule, however, is not absolute,
as the prominence of one faculty may be modified by the influence
of another; thus the faculty of <em>ham</em> may be modified by
that of <em>roast veal</em>, or the desire to indulge in a
sentiment for an <em>omelette</em> may be counteracted by a
propensity for a <em>fricandeau</em>, or by the regulating power of
a <em>Strasbourg pie</em>. The activity of the <em>omelette</em>
emotion is here not abated; the result to which it would lead, is
merely modified.</p>
<p>It would be tedious to detail the successive steps of my
inquiries, until I had at last ascertained distinctly that the
power of the eating faculties is, <em>c&aelig;teris paribus</em>,
in proportion to the size of those compartments in the stomach by
which they are manifested. I propose at a future time to explain my
system more fully, and shall conclude my present lecture by giving
a list of the organs into which I have classified the stomach,
according to my most careful observations.</p>

party broke up highly delighted.</p>
<p>A great party mustered on Friday last, in the New Cut, to hear
Mr. Briggles chant a new song, written on the occasion of the birth
of the young Prince. He was accompanied by his friend Mr. Handel
Purcell Mozart Muggins on the drum and mouth-organ, who afterwards
went round with his hat.</p>
<p>On Friday the lady of Paddy Green paid a morning call to Clare
Market, at the celebrated tripe shop; she purchased two slices of
canine comestibles which she carried home on a skewer.</p>
<p>Mrs. Paddy Green on Wednesday visited Mrs. Joel, to take tea.
She indulged in two crumpets and a dash of rum in the congou. It is
confidently reported that on Wednesday next Mrs. Joel will pay a
visit to Mrs. G. at her residence in Vere-street, to supper; after
which Mr. Paddy Green will leave for his <em>seat</em> in
Maiden-lane.</p>

<h3>HINTS ON POPPING THE QUESTION.</h3>
<div class="note">
<p><em>To the bashful, the hesitating, and the ignorant, the
following hints may prove useful</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>If you call on the &ldquo;loved one,&rdquo; and observe that she
blushes when you approach, give her hand a gentle squeeze, and if
she returns it, consider it &ldquo;all right&rdquo;&mdash;get the
parents out of the room, sit down on the sofa beside the
&ldquo;must adorable of her sex&rdquo;&mdash;talk of the joys of
wedded life. If she appears pleased, rise, seem excited, and at
once ask her to say the important, the life-or-death-deciding, the
suicide-or-happiness-settling question. If she pulls out her
cambric, be assured you are accepted. Call her &ldquo;My darling
Fanny!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;My own dear creature!&rdquo;&mdash;and a
few such-like names, and this completes the scene. Ask her to name
the day, and fancy yourself already in Heaven.</p>
<p>A good plan is to call on the &ldquo;object of your
affections&rdquo; in the forenoon&mdash;propose a walk&mdash;mamma
consents, in the hope you will declare your intentions. Wander
through the green fields&mdash;talk of &ldquo;love in a
cottage,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;requited attachment&rdquo;&mdash;and
&ldquo;rural felicity.&rdquo; If a child happens to pass, of course
intimate your fondness for the dear little creatures&mdash;this
will be a splendid hit. If the coast is clear, down you must fall
on your knee, right or left (there is no rule as to this), and
swear never to rise until she agrees to take you &ldquo;for better
and for worse.&rdquo; If, however, the grass is wet, and you have
white ducks on, or if your unmentionables are tightly made&mdash;of
course you must pursue another plan&mdash;say, vow you will blow
your brains out, or swallow arsenic, or drown yourself, if she
won&rsquo;t say &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you are at a ball, and your charmer is there, captivating all
around her, get her into a corner, and &ldquo;pop the
question.&rdquo; Some delay until after supper, but &ldquo;delays
are dangerous&rdquo;&mdash;Round-hand copy.</p>
<p>A young lady&rsquo;s &ldquo;tears,&rdquo; when accepting you,
mean &ldquo;I am too happy to speak.&rdquo; The dumb show of
staring into each other&rsquo;s faces, squeezing fingers, and
sighing, originated, we have reason to believe, with the ancient
Romans. It is much practised now-a-days&mdash;as saving breath, and
being more lover-like than talking.</p>
<p>We could give many more valuable hints, but Punch has something
better to do than to teach ninnies the art of amorifying.</p>

side,</p>
<p>The fifty-two who shared Te-pott&rsquo;s embraces</p>
<p class="i2">Were glad to see a stranger, though a

<p>And so received her with their gentlest graces,</p>
<p class="i2">And questions&mdash;though the questions are
implied,</p>
<p>For ladies, from Great Britain to the Tropics,</p>
<p>Are very orthodox in their choice of topics.</p>

<p>And had Y&mdash;Y&mdash;, who had eloped with Z&mdash;,</p>
<p class="i2">Been yet forgiven? and <em>had</em> she seen his

<p>And weren&rsquo;t they something between grey and red?</p>
<p class="i2">And hadn&rsquo;t Z&rsquo;s papa refused to give her
his?</p>
<p>So Hy-son told them everything she knew</p>
<p>And all was very well a day or two.</p>

<p>But, when the Multifarious forsook</p>

Gun-pow-der,</p>
<p>To revel in the lip and sunny look</p>
<p class="i2">Of the young stranger; spite of all they&rsquo;d
vow&rsquo;d her,</p>
<p>The ladies each with jealous anger shook,</p>
<p class="i2">And rail&rsquo;d against the simple maid
aloud&mdash;Ah!</p>
<p>This woman&rsquo;s pride is a fine thing to tell us
of&mdash;</p>
<p>But a small matter serves her to be jealous of.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>One said she was indecorously florid&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">One thought &ldquo;she only squinted, nothing
more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third, convulsively pronounced her &ldquo;horrid
&ldquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">While Bo-hea, who was <em>low</em> (at
four-and-four),</p>
<p>Glanced from her fingers up at Hy-son&rsquo;s forehead,</p>
<p class="i2">Who, inkling such a tendency before,</p>
<p>Cared for no rival&rsquo;s nails&mdash;but paid&mdash;I own,</p>
<p>Particular attention to her own.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Well, this was bad enough; but worse than this</p>
<p class="i2">Were the attentions of our ancient hero,</p>
<p>Whose frequent vow, and frequenter caress,</p>
<p class="i2">Unwelcome were for any one to hear, who</p>
<p>Had charms for better pleasure than a kiss</p>
<p class="i2">From feeble dotard ten degrees from zero.</p>
<p>So, as one does when circumstances harass one,</p>
<p>Hy-son began to draw up a comparison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was ever maiden so abused as I am?</p>

<p class="i2">A jointure&rsquo;s nothing among fifty-three!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m meek enough&mdash;but this I can <em>not</em>
bear&mdash;</p>
<p>I wish: I wish:&mdash;I wish a girl might swear!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>In such a mood, she&mdash;(stop! I&rsquo;ll mend my pen;</p>
<p class="i2">For now all our preliminaries <em>are</em> done,</p>
<p>And I am come unto the crisis, when</p>
<p class="i2">Her fate depends on a kind reader&rsquo;s
pardon)&mdash;</p>
<p>Wandering forth beyond the ladies&rsquo; ken,</p>
<p class="i2">She thought she spied a male face in the
garden&mdash;</p>
<p>She hasten&rsquo;d thither&mdash;she was not mistaken,</p>
<p>For sure enough, a man was there a-raking.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>A man complete he was who own&rsquo;d the visage,</p>
<p class="i2">A man of thirty-three, or may-be longer&mdash;</p>
<p>So young, she could not well distinguish his age&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">So old, she knew he had one day been younger.</p>
<p>Now thirty-three, although a very nice age,</p>
<p class="i2">Is not so nice as twenty, twenty-one, or</p>
<p>So; but of lovers when a lady&rsquo;s caught one,</p>
<p>She seldom stops to stipulate what sort o&rsquo; one.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Now, the first moment Hy-son saw the gardener&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">A gardener, by his tools and dress she
knew&mdash;</p>
<p>She felt her bosom round her heart in a&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">A&mdash;just as if her heart was breaking
through;</p>
<p>And so she blush&rsquo;d, and hoped that he would pardon her</p>
<p class="i2">Intruding on his grounds&mdash;&ldquo;so nice they
grew!&mdash;</p>
<p>Such roses! what a pink!&mdash;and then that peony;</p>
<p>Might she die if she ever look&rsquo;d to see any!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>The gardener offer&rsquo;d her a budding rose:</p>
<p class="i2">She took it with a smile, and colour&rsquo;d
high;</p>
<p>While, as she gave its fragrance to her nose,</p>
<p class="i2">He took the opportunity to sigh.</p>
<p>And Hy-son&rsquo;s cheek blush&rsquo;d like the daylight&rsquo;s
close!</p>
<p class="i2">She glanced around to see that none were nigh,</p>
<p>Then sigh&rsquo;d again and thought, &ldquo;Although a
peasant,</p>
<p>His manners are refined, and really pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>They stood each looking in the other&rsquo;s eyes,</p>
<p class="i2">Till Hy-son dropp&rsquo;d her gaze, and
then&mdash;good lack</p>
<p>Love is a cunning chapman: smiles, and sighs.</p>
<p class="i2">And tears, the choicest treasures in his pack!</p>
<p>Still barters he such baubles for the prize,</p>
<p class="i2">Which all regret when lost, yet can&rsquo;t get
back&mdash;</p>
<p>The heart&mdash;a useful matter in a bosom&mdash;</p>
<p>Though some folks won&rsquo;t believe it till they lose

<p class="i2">The gardener raised her hand unto his lip,</p>

<h2>KINGS AND CARPENTERS.&mdash;ROYAL AND VULGAR CONSPIRATORS.</h2>
<p>In a manuscript life of <em>Jemmy Twitcher</em>&mdash;the work
will shortly appear under the philosophical auspices of SIR LYTTON
BULWER&mdash;we find a curious circumstance, curiously paralleled
by a recent political event. <em>Jemmy</em> had managed to pass
himself off as a shrewd, cunning, but withal very honest sort of
fellow; he was, nevertheless, in heart and soul, a housebreaker of
the first order. One night, <em>Jemmy</em> quitted his respectable
abode, and, furnished with dark lantern, pistol, crowbar, and
crape, joined half-a-dozen neophyte burglars&mdash;his pupils and
his victims. The hostelry chosen for attack was &ldquo;The
Spaniards.&rdquo; The host and his servants were, however, on the
alert; and, after a smart struggle in the passage, the
housebreakers were worsted; two or three of them being killed, and
the others&mdash;save and except the cautious <em>Jemmy</em>, who
had only directed the movement from without&mdash;being fast in the
clutches of the constables. <em>Jemmy</em>, flinging away his crape
and his crowbar, ran home to his house&mdash;he was then living
somewhere in Petty France&mdash;went to bed, and the next morning
appeared as snug and as respectable as ever to his neighbours.
Vehement was his disgust at the knaves killed and caught in the
attack on &ldquo;The Spaniards;&rdquo; and though there were not
wanting bold speakers, who averred that <em>Twitcher</em> was at
the bottom of the burglary, nevertheless, his grave look, and the
character he had contrived to piece together for honest dealing,
secured him from conviction.</p>
<p><em>Jemmy Twitcher</em> was what the world calls a warm fellow.
He had gold in his chest, silver tankards on his board, pictures on
his walls; and more, he had a fine family of promising
<em>Twitchers</em>. One night, greatly to his horror at the
iniquity of man, miscreants surrounded his dwelling and fired
bullets at his children. The villains were apprehended; and the
hair of <em>Jemmy</em>&mdash;who had evidently forgotten all about
the affair at &ldquo;The Spaniards&rdquo;&mdash;stood on end, as
the conspiracy of the villains was revealed, as it was shown how,
in anticipation of a wicked success, they had shared among them,
not only his gold and his tankards, but the money and plate of all
his honest neighbours. <em>Jemmy</em>, still forgetful of
&ldquo;The Spaniards&rdquo; cried aloud for justice and the
gibbet!</p>
<p>Have we not here the late revolution in Spain&mdash;the
QUENISSET conspiracy&mdash;and in the prime mover of the first, and
the intended victim of the second rascality, KING LOUIS-PHILIPPE,
the JEMMY TWITCHER OF THE FRENCH?</p>
<p>The commission recently appointed in France for the examination
of the Communists and Equalised Operatives, taken in connexion with
the recent bloodshed under French royal authority, is another of
the ten thousand illustrations of the peculiar morality of crowned
heads. Here is a sawyer, a cabinet-maker, a cobbler, and such sort,
all food for the guillotine for attempting to do no more than has
been most treacherously perpetrated by the present King of the
French and the ex-Queen of Spain. How is it that LOUIS-PHILIPPE
feels no touch of sympathy for that pusillanimous
scoundrel&mdash;<em>Just</em>? He is naturally his veritable
double; but then <em>Just</em> is only a carpenter, LOUIS-PHILIPPE
is King of the French!</p>
<p>The reader has only to read Madrid for Paris&mdash;has only to
consider the sawyer Quenisset (the poor tool, trapped by
<em>Just</em>), the murdered Don Leon, or any other of the gallant
foolish victims of the French monarchy in the late atrocity in
Spain, to see the moral identity of the scoundrel carpenter and the
rascal king. We quote from the report:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Qu&eacute;nisset</em> (alias DON LEON)
examined.&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Just</em> said to me, pointing to the
body of officers, &lsquo;You must fire <em>into the midst of
those</em>;&rsquo; I then drew the pistol from under my shirt, and
discharged it with my left hand <em>in the direction I was
desired</em>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O&rsquo;DONNELL, LEON, ORA, BORIA, FULGOSIO, drew their pistols
at the order of LOUIS-PHILIPPE and CHRISTINA, and merely fired in
the direction they were desired!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Where was this society (the Ouvriers Egalitaires)
held?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Generally at the house of Colombier,
keeper of a wine-shop, Rue Traversi&egrave;re.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What formed the subject of discourse in these meetings,
when you were there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Different crimes</em>.
They talked of <em>overthrowing the throne, assassinating the
agents of the government&mdash;shedding blood, in
fact</em>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Rue Traversi&egrave;re we have only to read the Rue de
Courcelles&mdash;for Colombier the wine seller, CHRISTINA ex-Queen
of Spain. As for the subject of discourse at her Majesty&rsquo;s
hotel, events have bloodily proved that it was the overthrow of a
throne&mdash;the murder of the constituted authorities of
Spain&mdash;and, in the comprehensive meaning of
Qu&eacute;nisset&mdash;&ldquo;shedding blood, in fact!&rdquo; At
the wine-shop meetings the French conspirator tells us that there
was &ldquo;an old man, a locksmith,&rdquo; who would read
revolutionary themes, and &ldquo;electrify the souls of the young
men about him!&rdquo; The locksmith of the Rue de Courcelles was
the crafty, sanguinary policy of the monarch of the barricades. We
now come to MADAME COLOMBIER, <em>alias</em> QUEEN
CHRISTINA.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know whether your comrades had many
cartridges?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I do not know exactly what the
quantity was, but I heard a man say, and, Madame Colombier <em>also
boasted to another woman, that they had worked very hard, and for
some time past, at making cartridges</em>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Madame COLOMBIER, however, must cede in energy and boldness to
the reckless devilry of the Spanish ex-Queen; for the cartridges
manufactured by the wine-seller&rsquo;s wife were not to be
discharged into the bed-room of her own infant daughters! They were
certain not to shed the blood of her own children. Now the
cartridges of the Rue de Courcelles were made for any service.</p>
<p>One more extract from the confessions of QUENISSET
(<em>alias</em> DON LEON):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;At the corner of the Rue Traversi&egrave;re I saw Just,
Auguste, and several other young men, whom I had seen in the
morning receiving cartridges. Upon my asking whether the attack was
to be made, <em>Just answered, Yes</em>. He felt for his pistols;
my comrade got his ready under his blouse. I seized mine under my
shirt. Just called to me, &lsquo;<em>There, there, it is there you
are to fire.&rsquo; I fired. I thought that all the others would do
the same; but they made me swallow the hook, and then left me to my
fate, the rascals!</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Poor DON LEON! So far the parallel is complete. The pistol was
fired against Spanish liberty; and the royal Just, finding the
object missed, sneaks off, and leaves his dupe for the executioner.
There, however, the similitude fails. LOUIS-PHILIPPE sleeps in
safety&mdash;if, indeed, the ghosts of his Spanish victims let him
sleep at all; whilst for <em>Just</em>, the carpenter, he is marked
for the guillotine. Could Justice have her own, we should see the
King of the French at the bar of Spain; were the world guided by
abstract right, one fate would fall to the carpenter and the King.
History, however, will award his Majesty his just deserts. There is
a Newgate Calendar for Kings as well as for meaner culprits.</p>
<p>There are, it is said, at the present moment in France fifty
thousand communists; foolish, vicious men; many of them, doubtless,
worthy of the galleys; and many, for whom the wholesome discipline
of the mad-house would be at once the best remedy and punishment.
Fifty thousand men organised in societies, the object of which
is&mdash;what young France would denominate&mdash;philosophical
plunder; a relief from the canker-eating chains of matrimony; a
total destruction of all objects of art; and the common enjoyment
of stolen goods. It is against this unholy confederacy that the
moral force of LOUIS-PHILIPPE&rsquo;S Government is opposed. It is
to put down and destroy these bands of social brigands that the
King of the French burns his midnight oil; and then, having
extirpated the robber and the anarchist from France, his
Majesty&mdash;for the advancement of political and social
freedom&mdash;would kidnap the baby-Queen of Spain and her sister,
to hold them as trump cards in the bloody game of revolution. That
LOUIS-PHILIPPE, the <em>Just</em> of Spain, can consign his
fellow-conspirator, the <em>Just</em> of Paris, to the scaffold, is
a grave proof that there is no honour among a certain set of
enterprising men, whom the crude phraseology of the world has
denominated thieves.</p>
<p>It is to make the blood boil in our veins to read the account of
the execution of such men as LEON, ORA, and BORIA, the foolish
martyrs to a wicked cause. Never was a great social wrong dignified
by higher courage. Our admiration of the boldness with which these
men have faced their fate is mingled with the deepest regret that
the prime conspirators are safe in Paris; that one sits in derision
of justice on fellow criminals&mdash;on men whose crime may have
some slight extenuation from ignorance, want, or fancied cause of
revenge; that the other, with the surpassing meekness of
Christianity, goes to mass in her carriage, distributes her alms to
the poor, and, with her soul dyed with the blood of the young, the
chivalrous, and the brave, makes mouths at Heaven in very mockery
of prayer.</p>
<p>We once were sufficiently credulous to believe in the honesty of
LOUIS-PHILIPPE; we sympathised with him as a bold, able,
high-principled man fighting the fight of good government against a
faction of smoke-headed fools and scoundrel desperadoes. He has
out-lived our good opinion&mdash;the good opinion of the world. He
is, after all, a lump of crowned vulgarity. Pity it is that men,
the trusting and the brave, are made the puppets, the martyrs, of
such regality!</p>
<p>As for Queen CHRISTINA, her path, if she have any touch of
conscience, must be dogged by the spectres of her dupes. She is the
Madame LAFFARGE of royalty; nay, worse&mdash;the incarnation of
Mrs. BROWNRIGG. Indeed, what JOHNSON applied to another less
criminal person may be justly dealt upon her:&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, she
is not a woman, she is a speaking cat!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;They say the owl was a baker&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how the wheel becomes
it.&rdquo;&mdash;SHAKSPEARE.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>That immense cigar, our mild Cavannah, has at length met with
his deserts, and left the sage savans of the fool&rsquo;s hotbed,
London, the undisturbed possession of the diligently-achieved
fool&rsquo;s-caps their extreme absurdity, egregious folly, and
lout-like gullibility, have so splendidly qualified them to
support.</p>
<p>This extraordinary and Heaven-gifted faster is at length laid by
the heels. The full blown imposition has exploded&mdash;the
wretched cheat is consigned to merited durance; while the
trebly-<em>gammoned</em> and unexampled spoons who were his willing
dupes are in full possession of the enviable notoriety necessarily
attendant upon their extreme amount of unmitigated folly.</p>
<p>This egregious liar and finger-post for thrice inoculated fools
set out upon a provincial &ldquo;Starring and Starving
Expedition,&rdquo; issuing bills, announcing his wish to be open to
public inspection, and delicately hinting the absolute necessity of
shelling-out the browns, as though he, Bernard Cavanagh, did not
eat, yet he had a brother &ldquo;as did;&rdquo; consequently, ways
and means for the establishment and continuance of a small
commissariat for the ungifted fraternal was delicately hinted at in
the various documents containing the pressing invitations to
&ldquo;yokel population&rdquo; to honour him with an
inspection.</p>
<p>Numerous were the visitors and small the contributions attendant
upon the circulation of these &ldquo;documents in madness.&rdquo;
Many men are rather notorious in our great metropolis for
&ldquo;living upon nothing,&rdquo; that is, existing without the
aid of such hard food as starved the ass-eared Midas; out these
gentlemen of invisible ways and means have a very decent notion of
employing four out of the twenty four hours in supplying their
internal economy with such creature comforts as, in days of yore,
disinherited Esau, and procured a somewhat gastronomic celebrity
for the far-famed Heliogabalus. But a gentleman who could treat his
stomach like a postponed bill in the House of Commons&mdash;that
is, adjourn it <em>sine die</em>, or take it into consideration
&ldquo;this day seven years&rdquo;&mdash;was really a likely person
to attract attention and excite curiosity: accordingly, Bernard
Cavanagh was questioned closely by some of his visitors; but he,
like the speculation, appeared to be &ldquo;one not likely to
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparent efforts at concealment invariably lead to doubt, and,
doubt engendering curiosity, is very like to undergo, especially
from one of the fair sex, a scrutiny of the most searching kind.
Eve caused the fall of Adam&mdash;a daughter of Eve has discovered
and crushed this heretofore hidden mystery. This peculiarly
<em>empty</em> individual was discovered by the good
lady&mdash;despite the disguise of a black patch upon his nose and
an immeasurable outspread of Bandana superficially covering that
(as he asserted) useless orifice, his mouth&mdash;sneaking into the
far-off premises of a miscellaneous vendor of ready-dressed
eatables; and there Bernard the faster&mdash;the anti-nourishment
and terrestrial food-defying wonder&mdash;the certificated of
Heaven knows how many deacons, parsons, physicians, and
fools&mdash;demanded the very moderate allowance for his breakfast
of a twopenny loaf, a sausage, and a quarter of a pound of ham
<em>cut fat</em>: that&rsquo;s the beauty of it&mdash;cut fat! The
astonished witness of this singular purchase rushed at once to the
hotel: Cavanagh might contain the edibles, she could not: the
affair was blown; an investigation very properly adjudicated upon
the case; and three months&rsquo; discipline at the tread-mill is
now the reward of this arch-impostor&rsquo;s merits. So far so
good; but in the name of common sense let some experienced
practitioner in the art of &ldquo;cutting for the simples&rdquo; be
furnished with a correct list of the awful asses he has cozened at
&ldquo;hood-man blind;&rdquo; and pray Heaven they may each and
severally be operated on with all convenient speed!</p>

<h2>PROSPECTUS FOR A NEW HAND-BOOK OF JESTERS;</h2>
<h3>OR, YOUNG JOKER&rsquo;S BEST COMPANION.</h3>
<div class="note">
<p>&ldquo;All the world&rsquo;s a joke, and all the men and women
merely jokers.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Shakspeare</em>. From the text of
Joseph Miller.</p>
</div>
<p>Messrs. GAG and GAMMON beg most respectfully to call the strict
attention of the reading public to the following brief prospectus
of their forthcoming work &ldquo;On Jokes for all subjects.&rdquo;
Messrs. GAG and GAMMON pledge themselves to produce an article at
present unmatched for application and originality, upon such terms
as must secure them the patronage and lasting gratitude of their
many admirers. Messrs. GAG and GAMMON propose dividing their
highly-seasoned and warranted-to-keep-in-any-climate universal
faceti&aelig; into the following various heads, departments, or
classes:&mdash;</p>
<p>General jokes for all occasions; chiefly applicable to
individuals&rsquo; names, expressive of peculiar colours.</p>
<p>A very superior article on <em>Browns</em>&mdash;if required,
bringing in said Browns in Black and White.</p>
<p>Embarrassed do., very humorous, with <em>Duns</em>; and a choice
selection of unique references to the copper coin of the realm.
Worthy the attention of young beginners, and very safe for small
country towns, with one wit possessed of a good horse-laugh for his
own, or rather Messrs. G. and G.&rsquo;s jokes.</p>
<p>Do. do. on <em>Greens</em>, very various: bring in <em>Sap</em>
superbly, and <em>Pea</em> with peculiar power; with a short cut to
<em>Lettus (Lettuce)</em>, and Hanson&rsquo;s Patent
Safety,&mdash;a beautiful allusion to the &ldquo;Cab-age.&rdquo;
May be tried when there is an attorney and young doctor, with a
perfect certainty of success.</p>
<p>Do. do. do. On <em>Wiggins</em>; very pungent, suitable to the
present political position; offering a beautiful contrast of
Wig-<em>ins</em> and Wig-<em>outs</em>; capable of great
ramifications, and may be done at least twice a-night in a half
whisper in mixed society.</p>
<p>Also some &ldquo;Delightful Dinner Diversions, or Joke Sauces
for all Joints.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Calves-head</em>.&mdash;Brings in fellow-feeling; family
likeness; cannibalism;
&ldquo;t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te&rdquo;; while the brain sauce
and tongue are never-failing.</p>
<p><em>Goose</em>.&mdash;Same as above, with allusions to the
&ldquo;sage;&rdquo; two or three that <em>stick in the
gizzard</em>; and a beautiful work up with a &ldquo;long
liver.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Ducks</em>.&mdash;Very military: bring in <em>drill</em>;
drumsticks; breastwork; and pair of ducks for light clothing and
summer wear.</p>
<p><em>Snipes</em>.&mdash;Good for lawyers; long bill. Gallantry;
&ldquo;Toast be dear Woman.&rdquo; Mercantile; run on banks. And
infants; living on suction.</p>
<p><em>Herring</em>.&mdash;Capital for <em>bride</em>:
<em>her-ring</em>; petticoats, flannel and otherwise,
<em>herring-boned</em>. Fat people; <em>bloaters</em>; &amp;c.
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p><em>Venison</em>.&mdash;Superior, for offering everybody some of
your sauce. Sad subject, as it ought to be looked upon with a grave
eye (<em>gravy</em>). Wish your friends might always give you such
<em>a cut</em>. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p><em>Port</em>.&mdash;Like well-baked bread, best when crusty;
flies out of glass because of the &ldquo;bee&rsquo;s wing.&rdquo;
Always happy to become a <em>porter</em> on such occasions; object
to general breakages, but partial to the cracking of a bottle;
comes from a good &ldquo;cellar&rdquo; and a good buyer, though no
wish to be a good-bye-er to it. All the above with beautiful
leading cues, and really with two or three rehearsals the very best
things ever done.</p>
<p><em>Sherry</em>.&mdash;&ldquo;Do you sherry?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not
just yet.&rdquo; &ldquo;Rather unlucky, <em>white whining</em>:
like a bottle of port; but no objection to <em>share he</em>. Hope
never to be out of the Pale of do.; if so, will submit to be done
Brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;After an election dinner, any of the above valued at
a six weeks&rsquo; invitation from any voter under the influence of
his third bottle; and absolute reversion of the chair, when
original chairman disappears under table.</p>
<p><em>Champagne</em>.&mdash;Real pleasure (quite new&mdash;never

<h3>DISCOVERY OF VALUABLE JEWELS.</h3>
<p>Public curiosity has been a good deal excited lately by
mysterious rumours concerning some valuable jewels, which, it was
said, had been discovered at the Exchequer. The pill-box supposed
to enclose these costly gems being solemnly opened, it was found to
contain nothing but an antique pair of false promises, set in
copper, once the property of Sir Francis Burdett; and a bloodstone
amulet, ascertained to have belonged to the Duke of Wellington. The
box was singularly enough tied with red official tape, and sealed
with treasury wax, the motto on the seal being &ldquo;<em>Requiscat
in Pace</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>SAYINGS &amp; DOINGS IN THE ROYAL NURSERY.</h3>
<p>We are enabled to assure our readers that his Royal Highness the
Duke of Cornwall has appointed Lord Glengall pap-spoon in waiting
to his Royal Highness.</p>
<p>The Lord Mayor, Lord Londonderry, Sir Peter Laurie, Sir John
Key, Colonel Sibthorp, Mr. Goulburn, Peter Borthwick, Lord
Ashburton, and Sir E.L. Bulwer, were admitted to an interview with
his Royal Highness, who received them in &ldquo;full cry,&rdquo;
and was graciously pleased to confer on our Sir Peter extraordinary
proofs of his royal condescension. The distinguished party
afterwards had the honour of partaking of caudle with the
nursery-maids.</p>
<p>Sir John Scott Lillie has informed us confidentially, that he is
not the individual of that name who has been appointed monthly
nurse in the Palace. Sir John feels that his qualifications ought
to have entitled him to a preference.</p>
<p>The captain of the <em>Britannia</em> states that he fell in
with two large whales between Dover and Boulogne on last Monday.
There is every reason to believe they were coming up the Thames to
offer their congratulations to the future Prince of

<h3>THE REWARD OF VIRTUE.</h3>
<p>We understand that Sir Peter Laurie has been presented with the
Freedom of the Barber&rsquo;s Company, enclosed in a pewter

<p>A difficulty, it is thought, may arise in bestowing the
customary honour upon the chief magistrate of the city, upon the
birth of a male heir to the throne, in consequence of the Prince
being born on the day on which the late Mayor went out and the
present one came into office. Sir Peter Laurie suggests that a
petition be presented to the Queen, praying that her Majesty may

<h2>PUNCH&rsquo;S THEATRE.</h2>
<h3>COURT AND CITY.</h3>
<p>The other evening, the public were put in possession, at Covent
Garden Theatre, of a new branch of art in play concoction, which
may be called &ldquo;dramatic distillation.&rdquo; By this process
the essence of two or more old comedies is extracted; their
characters and plots amalgamated; and the whole
&ldquo;rectified&rdquo; by the careful expunction of equivocal
passages. Finally, the <em>drame</em> is offered to the public in
<em>act</em>ive potions; five of which are a dose.</p>
<p>The forgotten plays put into the still on this occasion were
&ldquo;The Discovery,&rdquo; by Mrs. Frances Sheridan, and
&ldquo;The Tender Husband,&rdquo; by Sir Richard Steele. From one,
that portion which relates to the &ldquo;City,&rdquo; is taken; the
&ldquo;Court&rdquo; end of the piece belonging to the other. In
fact, even in their modern dress, they are two distinct dramas,
only both are played at once&mdash;a wholesome economy being thus
exercised over time, actors, scenery, and decorations: the only
profusion required is in the article of patience, of which the
audience must be very liberal.</p>
<p>The courtiers consist of <em>Lord Dangerfield</em>, who
although, or&mdash;to speak in a sense more strictly
domestic&mdash;because, he has got a wife of his own, falls in love
with the young spouse of young <em>Lord Whiffle</em>; then there is
<em>Sir Paladin Scruple</em>, who, having owned to eighteen
separate tender declarations during fourteen years, dangles after
<em>Mrs. Charmington</em>, an enchanting widow, and <em>Louisa
Dangerfield</em>, an insipid spinster, the latter being in love
with his son.</p>
<p>The citizens consist of the <em>famille Bearbinder</em>, parents
and daughter, together with <em>Sir Hector Rumbush</em> and a
clownish son, who the former insists shall marry the sentimental
<em>Barbara Bearbinder</em>, but who, accordingly, does no such
thing.</p>
<p>The dialogues of these two &ldquo;sets&rdquo; go on quite
independent of each other, action there is none, nor plot, nor,
indeed, any progression of incident whatever. <em>Lord
Dangerfield</em> tells you, in the first scene, he is trying to
seduce <em>Lady Whiffle</em>, and you know he won&rsquo;t get her.
Directly you hear that <em>Sir Paladin Scruple</em> has declared in
favour of <em>Miss Dangerfield</em>, you are quite sure she will
marry the son; in short, there is not the glimmer of an incident
throughout either department of the play which you are not
scrupulously prepared for&mdash;so that the least approach to
expectation is nipped in the bud. The whole fable is carefully
developed after all the characters have once made their
introduction; hence, at least three of the acts consist entirely of
events you have been told are going to happen, and of the
fulfilment of intentions already expressed.</p>
<p>One character our enumeration has omitted&mdash;that of <em>Mr.
Winnington</em>, who being a lawyer, stock and marriage broker, is
the bosom friend and confident of every character in the piece,
and, consequently, is the only person who has intercourse with the
two sets of characters. This is a part patched up to be the
sticking plaster which holds the two plots together&mdash;-the flux
that joins the <em>mettle</em>some <em>Captain Dangerfield</em>
(son of the Lord) to the sentimental <em>citoyenne</em> <em>Barbara
Bearbinder</em>. In fact, <em>Winnington</em> is the author&rsquo;s
go-between, by which he maketh the twain comedies one&mdash;the
Temple Bar of the play&mdash;for he joineth the &ldquo;Court&rdquo;
with the &ldquo;City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So much for construction: now for detail. The legitimate object
of comedy is the truthful delineation of manners. In life, manners
are displayed by what people do, and by what they say. Comedy,
therefore, ought to consist of action and dialogue. (&ldquo;Thank
you,&rdquo; exclaims our reader, &ldquo;for this wonderful
discovery!&rdquo;) Now we have seen that in &ldquo;Court and
City&rdquo; there is little action: hence it may be supposed that
the brilliancy of the dialogue it was that tempted the author to
brush away the well-deserved dust under which the
&ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Tender Husband&rdquo; have
been half-a-century imbedded. But this supposition would be
entirely erroneous. The courtiers and citizens themselves were but
dull company: it was chiefly the acting that kept the audience on
the benches and out of their beds.</p>
<p>Without action or wit, what then renders the comedy endurable?
It is this: all the parts are individualities&mdash;they speak,
each and every of them, exactly such words, by which they give
utterance to such thoughts, as are characteristic of him or
herself, each after his kind. In this respect the &ldquo;Court and
City&rdquo; presents as pure a delineation of manners as a play
without incident can do&mdash;a truer one, perhaps, than if it were
studded with brilliancies; for in private life neither the denizens
of St. James&rsquo;s, nor those of St. Botolph&rsquo;s, were ever
celebrated for the brilliancy of their wit. Nor are they at
present; if we may judge from the fact of Colonel Sibthorp being
the representative of the one class, and Sir Peter Laurie the
oracle of the other.</p>
<p>This nice adaptation of the dialogue to the various characters,
therefore, offers scope for good acting, and gets it. Mr. Farren,
in <em>Sir Paladin Scruple</em>, affords what tradition and social
history assure us is a perfect portraiture of an old gentleman of
the last century;&mdash;more than that, of a singular, peculiar old
gentleman. And yet this excellent artist, in portraying the
peculiarities of the individual, still preserves the general
features of the class. The part itself is the most difficult in
nature to make tolerable on the stage, its leading characteristic
being wordiness. <em>Sir Paladin</em>, a gentleman (in the ultra
strict sense of that term) seventy years of age, is desirous of the
character of <em>un homme de bonnes fortunes</em>. Cold, precise,
and pedantic, he tells the objects&mdash;not of his flame&mdash;but
of his declarations, that he is consumed with passion, dying of
despair, devoured with love&mdash;talking at the same time in
parenthetical apologies, nicely-balanced antitheses, and behaving
himself with the most frigid formality. His bow (that old-fashioned
and elaborate manual exercise called &ldquo;making a leg&rdquo;) is
in itself an epitome of the manners and customs of the
ancients.</p>
<p>Madame Vestris and Mr. C. Matthews played <em>Lady</em> and
<em>Lord Whiffle</em>&mdash;two also exceedingly difficult
characters, but by these performers most delicately handled. They
are a very young, inexperienced (almost childish), and quarrelsome
couple. Frivolity so extreme as they were required to represent
demands the utmost nicety of colouring to rescue it from silliness
and inanity. But the actors kept their portraits well up to a
pleasing standard, and made them both quite <em>spirituels</em>
(more French&mdash;that <em>Morning Post</em> will be the ruin of
us), as well as in a high degree natural.</p>
<p>All the rest of the players, being always and altogether actors,
within the most literal meaning of the word, were exactly the same
in this comedy as they are in any other. Mr. Diddear had in
<em>Lord Dangerfield</em> one of those <span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>[pg 240]</span>parts which is generally
confided to gentlemen who deliver the dialogue with one hand thrust
into the bosom of the vest&mdash;the other remaining at liberty,
with which to saw the air, or to shake hands with a friend. Mr.
Harley played the part of Mr. Harley (called in the bills
<em>Humphrey Rumbush</em>) precisely in the same style as Mr.
Harley ever did and ever will, whatever dress he has worn or may
wear. The rest of the people we will not mention, not being anxious
for a repetition of the unpleasant fits of yawning which a too
vivid recollection of their dulness might re-produce. The only
merit of &ldquo;Court and City&rdquo; being in the
dialogue&mdash;the only merit of that consisting of minute and
subtle representations of character, and these folks being utterly
innocent of the smallest perception of its meaning or
intention&mdash;the draughts they drew upon the patience of the
audience were enormous, and but grudgingly met. But for the acting
of Farren and the managers, the whole thing would have been an
unendurable infliction. As it was, it afforded a capital
illustration of</p>

<p>ATTRACTION AND REPULSION.</p>
</div>
<hr class="short" />
<h3>TEN THOUSAND A-YEAR!</h3>
<p>The dramatic capabilities of &ldquo;Ten Thousand a-Year,&rdquo;
as manifested in the vicissitudes that happen to the Yatton Borough
(appropriately recorded by Mr. Warren in <em>Blackwood&rsquo;s
Magazine</em>), have been fairly put to the test by a popular and
<em>Peake</em>-ante play-wright. What a subject! With ten thousand
a-year a man may do anything. There is attraction in the very sound
of the words. It is well worth the penny one gives for a bill to
con over those rich, euphonious, delicious syllables&mdash;TEN
THOUSAND A-YEAR! Why, the magic letters express the concentrated
essence of human felicity&mdash;the <em>summum bonum</em> of mortal
bliss!</p>
<p><em>Charles Aubrey</em>, of Yatton, in the county of York,
Esquire, possesses ten thousand a-year in landed property, a lovely
sister in yellow satin, a wife who can sing, and two charming
children, who dance the mazourka as well as they do it at
Almack&rsquo;s, or at Mr. Baron Nathan&rsquo;s. As is generally the
case with gentlemen of large fortunes, he is the repository of all
the cardinal virtues, and of all the talents. Good husbands, good
fathers, good brothers, and idolised landlords, are plenty enough;
but a man who, like <em>Aubrey</em>, is all these put together, is
indeed a scarce article; the more so, as he is also a profound
scholar, and an honest statesman. In short, though pretty well
versed in the paragons of virtue that belong to the drama, we find
this <em>Charles Aubrey</em> to be the veriest angel that ever wore
black trousers and pumps.</p>
<p>The most exalted virtue of the stage is, in the long run, seen
in good circumstances, and <em>vice versa</em>; for, in this
country, one of the chief elements of crime is poverty. Hence the
picture is reversed; we behold a striking contrast&mdash;a scene
antithetical. We are shown into a miserable garret, and introduced
to a vulgar, illiterate, cockneyfied, dirty, dandified
linendraper&rsquo;s shopman, in the person of <em>Tittlebat
Titmouse</em>. In the midst of his distresses his attention is
directed to a &ldquo;Next of Kin&rdquo; advertisement. It relates
to him and to the Yatton property; and if you be the least
conversant with stage effect, you know what is coming: though the
author thinks he is leaving you in a state of agonising suspense by
closing the act.</p>
<p>The next scene is the robing-room of the York Court-house; and
the curtains at the back are afterwards drawn aside to disclose a
large cupboard, meant to represent an assize-court. On one shelf of
it is seated a supposititious Judge, surrounded by some half-dozen
pseudo female spectators; the bottom shelf being occupied by
counsel, attorney, crier of the court, and plaintiff. The special
jury are severally called in to occupy the right-hand shelf; and
when the cupboard is quite full, all the forms of returning a
verdict are gone through. This is for the plaintiff! Mr. Aubrey is
ruined; and <em>Mr. Titmouse</em> jumps about, at the imminent risk
of breaking the cupboard to pieces, having already knocked down a
counsel or two, and rolled over his own attorney.</p>
<p>This idea of dramatising proceedings at <em>nisi prius</em> only
shows the state of destitution into which the promoters of stage
excitement have fallen. The Baileys, Old and New, have, from
constant use, lost their charms; the police officers were
completely worn out by Tom and Jerry, Oliver Twist, &amp;c.; so
that now, all the courts left to be &ldquo;done&rdquo; for the
drama are the Exchequer and Ecclesiastical, Secondaries and
Summonsing, Petty Sessions and Prerogative. But what is to happen
when these are exhausted? The answer is obvious:&mdash;Mr. Yates
will turn his attention to the Church! Depend upon it, we shall
soon have the potent Paul Bedford, or the grave and reverend Mr.
John Saunders, in solemn sables, <em>converting</em> the stage into
a Baptist meeting, and repentant supernumeraries with the real
water!</p>
<p>Hoping to be forgiven for this, perhaps misplaced, levity, we
proceed to Act III., in which we find that, fortune having shuffled
the cards, and the judge and jury cut them, <em>Mr. Titmouse</em>
turns up possessor of Yatton and ten thousand a-year; while
<em>Aubrey</em>, quite at the bottom of the pack, is in a state of
destitution. To show the depth of distress into which he has
fallen, a happy expedient is hit upon: he is described as turning
his attention and attainments to literature; and that the
unfathomable straits he is put to may be fully understood, he is
made a reviewer! Thus the highest degree of sympathy is excited
towards him; for everybody knows that no person would willingly
resort to criticism (literary or dramatic) as a means of
livelihood, if he could command a broom and a crossing to earn a
penny by, or while there exists a Mendicity Society to get soup
from.</p>
<p>We have yet to mention one character; and considering that he is
the main-spring of the whole matter, we cannot put it off any
longer. <em>Mr. Gammon</em> is a lawyer&mdash;that is quite enough;
we need not say more. You all know that stage solicitors are more
outrageous villains than even their originals. <em>Mr. Gammon</em>
is, of course, a &ldquo;fine speciment of the specious,&rdquo; as
Mr. Hood&rsquo;s Mr. Higgings says. It is he who, finding out a
flaw in <em>Aubrey&rsquo;s</em> title, angled per advertisement for
the heir, and caught a <em>Tittlebat&mdash;Titmouse</em>. It is he
who has so disinterestedly made that gentleman&rsquo;s
fortune.&mdash;&ldquo;Only just merely for the sake of the
costs?&rdquo; one naturally asks. Oh no; there is a stronger reason
(with which, however, reason has nothing to do)&mdash;love! <em>Mr.
Gammon</em> became desperately enamoured of <em>Miss Aubrey</em>;
but she was silly enough to prefer the heir to a peerage, <em>Mr.
Delamere. Mr. Gammon</em> never forgave her, and so ruins her
brother.</p>
<p>Having brought the whole family to a state in which he supposes
they will refuse nothing, <em>Gammon</em> visits <em>Miss
Aubrey</em>, and, in the most handsome manner, offers
her&mdash;notwithstanding the disparity in their
circumstances&mdash;his hand, heart, and fortune. More than that,
he promises to restore the estate of Yatton to its late possessor.
To his astonishment the lady rejects him; and, he showing what the
bills call the &ldquo;cloven foot,&rdquo; <em>Miss Aubrey</em>
orders him to be shown out. Meantime, <em>Mr. Tittlebat
Titmouse</em>, having been returned M.P. for Yatton, has made a
great noise in house, not by his oratorical powers, but by his
proficient imitations of cock-crowing and donkey-braying.</p>
<p>This being Act IV., it is quite clear that
<em>Gammon&rsquo;s</em> villany and <em>Tittlebat&rsquo;s</em>
prosperity cannot last much longer. Both are ended in an original
manner. True to the principle with which the Adelphi commenced its
season&mdash;that of putting stage villany into comedy&mdash;Mr.
Gammon concludes the <em>faceti&aelig;</em> with which his part
abounds by a comic suicide! All the details of this revolting
operation are gone through amidst the most ponderous levity;
insomuch, that the audience had virtue enough to hiss most
lustily<sup>3</sup><span class="sidenote">3. While this page was
passing through the press, we witnessed a representation of
&ldquo;Ten Thousand a-Year&rdquo; a second time, and observed that
the offensiveness of this scene was considerably abated. Mr. Lyon
deserves a word of praise for his acting in that passage of the
piece as it now stands.</span> .</p>
<p>Thus the string of rascality by which the piece is held together
being cut, it naturally finishes by the reinstatement of
Aubrey&mdash;together with a view of Yatton in sunshine, a
procession of charity children, mutual embraces by all the
characters, and a song by Mrs. Grattan. What becomes of
<em>Titmouse</em> is not known, and did not seem to be much cared
about.</p>
<p>This piece is interesting, not because it is cleverly
constructed (for it is not), nor because <em>Mr. Titmouse</em> dyes
his hair green with a barber&rsquo;s nostrum, nor on account of the
cupboard court of <em>Nisi Prius</em>, nor of the charity children,
nor because Mr. Wieland, instead of playing the devil himself,
played <em>Mr. Snap</em>, one of his limbs&mdash;but because many
of the scenes are well-drawn pictures of life. The children&rsquo;s
ball in the first &ldquo;epoch,&rdquo; for instance, was altogether
excellently managed and <em>true</em>; and though many of the
characters are overcharged, yet we have seen people like them in
Chancery-lane, at Messrs. Swan and Edgar&rsquo;s, in country
houses, and elsewhere. The suicide incident is, however, a
disgusting drawback.</p>
<p>The acting was also good, but too extravagantly so. Mr. Wright,
as <em>Titmouse</em>, thought perhaps that a Cockney dandy could
not be caricatured, and he consequently went desperate lengths, but
threw in here and there a touch of nature. Mr. Lyon was as
energetic as ever in <em>Gammon</em>; Mrs. Yates as lugubrious as
is her wont in <em>Miss Aubrey</em>; Mrs. Grattan acted and looked
as if she were quite deserving of a man with ten thousand a year.
As to her singing, if her husband were in possession of twenty
thousand per annum, (would to the gods he were!) it could not have
been more charmingly tasteful. The pathetics of Wilkinson (as
<em>Quirk</em>) in the suicide scene, and just before the event,
deserve the attention and imitation of Macready. We hope the former
comedian&rsquo;s next character will be Ion, or, at least, Othello.
He has now proved that smaller parts are beneath his purely
histrionic talents.</p>
<p>Mr. Yates did not make a speech! This extraordinary omission set
the house in a buzz of conjectural wonderment till &ldquo;The Maid
of Honour&rdquo; put a stop to it.</p>
<p>NOTE.&mdash;A critique on this piece would have appeared last
week, if it had pleased some of the people at the post-office
(through which the MS. was sent to the Editors) not to steal it.
Perhaps they took it for something valuable; and, perhaps, they
were not mistaken. Thanks be to Mercury, we have plenty of wit to
spare, and can afford some of it to be stolen now and then. Still
we entreat Colonel Maberly (Editor of the &ldquo;Post&rdquo; in St.
Martin&rsquo;s-le-Grand) to supply his clerks with jokes enough to
keep them alive, that they may not be driven to steal other
people&rsquo;s. The most effectual way to preserve them in a state
of jocular honesty would be for him to present every person on the
establishment with a copy of &ldquo;Punch&rdquo; from week to
week.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
